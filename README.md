## How to use

For compilation:

* Install the dependencies: Eigen, Ceres Solver and OpenCV.

* Clone the repository.

* Build with 

  ```shell
  mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  .. && make -j8
  ```

  > you will need a compiler supporting C++17.

* Tested in Ubuntu 18.04 (with GCC 9.0 and CMake 3.11), and macOS 10.14.

For execution:
* `path/to/pvio-pc [data_scheme]://[data_path] [config_yaml_path] [result.tum]`
  * e.g.
    * For EuRoC Dataset: `build/pvio-pc/pvio-pc euroc:///Data/EuRoC/V1_01_easy/mav0 config/euroc.yaml result/trajectory.tum`
    * For TUM-VI Dataset: `build/pvio-pc/pvio-pc tum:///Data/TUM_VI/dataset-room1_512_16/mav0 config/tum_vi.yaml result/trajectory.tum`
* The trajectory will be written in `trajectory.tum`.
